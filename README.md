# Cryptography-Messaging-Between-2-Clients
The following repository simply launches a server to let 2 clients have encrypted channels to send messages to communicate between each other.

Simply run the chat_server.py first. This file will set up the channel to create instances of communication between 2 clients

This is also a good start to begin implementing further complex communication between the two clients. 
Then , run the main file that will use the ports you mention in the terminal to encrypt your first message, decrypt the same at the client's end and finally display the same at the 2nd Client's end
